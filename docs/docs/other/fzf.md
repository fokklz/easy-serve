# Fuzzy Finder: fzf

fzf is a powerful command-line fuzzy finder that provides a user-friendly interface for searching and selecting items from a list. While it is commonly used as a command-line tool, it also offers a rich UI experience.

## Searchable Interface

One of the key features of fzf is its searchable interface. When presented with a list of items, you can start typing to filter the items based on your input. As you type, fzf dynamically updates the list to show only the items that match your search query. This makes it incredibly efficient to find specific items, even in large lists.

## Multi-Selection with Tab

Another useful feature of fzf is its ability to handle multi-selection. When presented with a list of items, you can use the Tab key to select multiple items. Each selected item is highlighted, allowing you to easily keep track of your selections. This feature is particularly handy when you need to perform actions on multiple items simultaneously.
