# Not actually GitHub hooks, but Git hooks

This directory contains your project's Git hooks. Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as: commit, push, and receive. Git hooks are a built-in feature - no need to download anything. They are run locally. 

The project is configured to use copy all the hooks from this directory to the .git/hooks directory. This is done by running the `Setup Git Hooks` Action in VS Code.
